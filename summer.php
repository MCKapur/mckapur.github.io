	<h1>Summer navigator</h1>
	<h3>A summer of experimentation and doing cool shit. No structure.</h3>
	<p>Goals:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>“Sort myself out” — Peterson style. Take inspiration from Nick. This means being more disciplined, do tasks I don’t feel like doing just because they’re menial, more motivated, doing things that I set out for myself, less fooling around / bumming around, more upfront to reality with myself. Live more independently.</li>
	<li>Get on track for O-1 visa. Keep on track. Go for it.</li>
	<li>Keep challenging myself re. socially and re. girls. Use therapy as help where the help is needed.</li>
	<li>Realize certain dreams that I have, where I have the capacity to, in SF. This is especially relevant towards music.</li>
	<li>Pursue excellence in whatever I’m working towards, where relevant. Don’t have tunnel vision towards one goal eg. “visa” or “green card”. Relevant to work eg. like Alex’s. If I built a really cool influencer solution, this optimizes for serendipity.</li>
	<li>Create, learn, have fun.</li>
	<li>Be more conservative with my money! Much more conservative.</li>
	</ol>
