			<h2>Hi! My name is Rohan.</h2>
			<p id="tagline">> I’m an 18 year old striving to<br>maximize long-term personal<br>fulfillment.</p>

			<p class="header">_ABOUT_</p>
			<div class="textbody">
				<p>I was born and raised in Melbourne, spent my teen years in Singapore, and am now based in the Bay Area. 🇦🇺🇸🇬🇺🇸</p>
				<p>Early on, I was infatuated with Green Day (I still am.) To get my constant <i>American Idiot</i> fix I bought an iPod, initiating me into the Apple cult. One day I stumbled upon Xcode, an app you could use to... create other apps! From then on, I became student by day, iOS dev by night.</p>
				<p>When I was 14, I won a scholarship to attend Apple's WWDC 2013. It was the most significant week of my life. I joined a global community of young developers seeking to do great things, from which I have come close to some of the most ambitious and impactful young people in the world. I am eternally grateful to Apple for these platforms and opportunities.</p>
				<p>In high school, I made lots of things: products, businesses, code, music, articles, etc., most of the time with <a href="http://lenny.io">Lenny Khazan</a>. You can see these lower down the page.</p>
				<p>In 2016, I was admitted to Stanford University. Since arriving, I've been influenced by a few students/alumni who've offered invaluable advice for developing and pursuing my goals. During freshman fall, I engaged in 3 months of reading and self-reflection. My aim was to take a step back and figure things out, short and long-term, from first principles. I'm proud of the final outcome: a <a href="https://mckapur.quip.com/OQPOArha0i3K">plan</a> that defines myself and my path going forward.</p>
